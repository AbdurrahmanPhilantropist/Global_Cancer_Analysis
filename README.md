# Global Cancer Mortality Analysis (2021)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global cancer mortality data for the year 2021, breaking down cancer deaths by type and country. The objective is to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights that can guide healthcare strategies and research focus.

### Dataset
- **Source**: Global Cancer Mortality Statistics (2021)
- **Size**: 2,000+ records, covering 195 countries and 20+ cancer types.
- **Preprocessing**: Handled 5% missing values, corrected mislabeled columns.

### Analysis & Tools
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
- **Visualizations**: Heatmaps, bar charts, trend analysis

### Key Insights
- **Top 10 countries** (e.g., India, China, USA) contribute **40%** of global cancer deaths.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa** and **South Asia** are identified as high-risk regions with disproportionately high mortality rates.
- **Correlation** between cancer deaths and population size: **0.85**.

### How to Run the Code
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
